# Augmenting-Image-Data-for-Deep-Learning

**Welcome to our GitHub repository!** This project is centred around enhancing the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) through the integration of synthetic images generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

## Research Aims

The primary focus of this research is to assess the impact of GAN-based data augmentation on the classification capabilities of CNNs. We explore this within the context of medical chest X-ray (CXR) analysis, specifically targeting disease class identification challenges posed by the class imbalance within the CXR8 dataset.

## Methodology

1. **Pre-trained CNNs**: All CNN models used in this study are pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset to leverage existing learned features relevant to general image recognition.
2. **StyleGAN2 for Synthetic Image Generation**: We employ StyleGAN2, trained on individual disease classes from the CXR8 dataset, to generate synthetic images. This allows us to enhance the dataset for each class, aiming to provide balanced training material for the CNNs.
3. **Evaluation**: The performance of CNNs trained on the original vs. augmented datasets is meticulously compared. This involves integrating varying numbers of synthetic images into the training process to discern the optimal use of synthetic data in improving classification accuracy.

## Objectives

1. To determine the effective ratios of synthetic to real images that contribute positively to CNN performance.
2. To understand the quality impact of synthetic images on model training and generalisation capabilities.

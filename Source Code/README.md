This folder contains all the code used in this project.

This is a brief description of what each notebook does.

| Notebook            | Description                                                                                      |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Augmented Training  | Trains the CNNs and evaluates them on the augmented datasets.                                    |
| CNN Training        | Trains the CNNs and evaluates them on both the original and augmented datasets.                  |
| GAN Training        | Trains StyleGAN2 on the original dataset, and generates images for each class.                   |
| IQA                 | Conducts Image Quality Analysis (IQA) on the original and generated images, and compares results.|
| Separate Classes    | Separates the original dataset into the different disease classes, and creates a folder for each class. |


The trained StyleGAN Models can be accessed [here](https://entuedu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/mlim088_e_ntu_edu_sg/EpTot_aeZLxFmswdM_bAsrgBkqo3VxtLrcv8e4PC-YNl7Q?e=EY5DqR).

The models are trained at a resolution of 256 pixels by 256 pixels, you can observe the effect of overtraining by comparing the iamges generated by the 5000kimg and 25000kimg models. All images generated in this project were generated using the 5000kimg models.
